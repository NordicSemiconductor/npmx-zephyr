The Timer sample demonstrates how to control the PMIC TIMER peripheral with the use of npmx drivers.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

.. table-from-sample-yaml::

The sample also requires an nPM1300 EK.

Overview
********

This sample uses the Timer driver to configure and run a timer.
The TIMER peripheral is configured to generate an interrupt after ~400 ms.
If the interrupt from the PMIC does not occur within 500 ms, an error message is printed to the console.

Wiring
******

#. Connect the TWI interface between the chosen DK and the nPM1300 EK as in the following table:

   .. list-table:: nPM1300 EK connections.
     :widths: 25 25 25
     :header-rows: 1

     * - nPM1300 EK pins
       - nRF5340 DK pins
       - nRF52840 DK pins
     * - GPIO0
       - P1.10
       - P1.10
     * - SDA
       - P1.02
       - P0.26
     * - SCL
       - P1.03
       - P0.27
     * - VOUT2 & GND
       - External supply (P21)
       - External supply (P21)

#. Make the following connections on the chosen DK:

   * Set the **SW9** nRF power source switch to **VDD**.
   * Set the **SW10** VEXT â†’ nRF switch to **ON**.

#. Make the following connections on the nPM1300 EK:

   .. include:: /includes/npm1300_ek_connections.txt
